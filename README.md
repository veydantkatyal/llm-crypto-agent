# LLM-Powered Data Analysis Agent

This repository showcases the creation of an LLM-Powered Data Analysis Agent, leveraging powerful tools such as LangChain, Groq, Llama 3, and Exa for efficient data handling and analysis. It provides a framework for analyzing cryptocurrencies. A user can ask for a cryptocurrency report, which triggers an agent to gather relevant news, another agent to analyze prices, and then a final report summarizing the market and making predictions.

## Key Features

- **LangChain Integration** for managing LLM-powered workflows.
- **Custom cryptocurrency price tool** to fetch historical prices.
- **News tool** to get real-time cryptocurrency news.
- **LLM-powered Agents** for tasks like price analysis, news analysis, and report writing.
